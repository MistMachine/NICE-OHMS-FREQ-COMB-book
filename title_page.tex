This is just a place holder title page. This book is aimed at teaching people who are completely new to the field of {\bfseries{LASER SPECTROSCOPY}}. I will therefore be steering away from unnecessarily pretentious language while trying to be professional. I will be cracking jokes and hip references though, so not too professional. My goal is to teach in a fun manner, not sound like a pretentious stick in the mud snob. What I care about are results, not appearances.
